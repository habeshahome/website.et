# React Design Patterns

## Component Design Patterns 

1. HOC Pattern (class based react)
   - Decorated Component
   - Pure Function

2. Provider Pattern
   - Provider Component
   - Consumer Component / Custom Hook
   - (Context API or Redux or Recoil)
  
3. Compound Components Pattern
   - (Advanced RDP)
   - (ex: Select vs Options)
  
4. The Hooks Pattern (v16.8+)
   - Supercharging functional components
React functional components a simple and direct way to access common React features such as props, state, context, refs, and lifecycle
The result of this is that functional components do not have to be dumb components anymore as they can use state, hook into a component lifecycle, perform side effects, and more from a functional component. These features were originally only supported by class components.
